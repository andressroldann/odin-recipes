# Odin Recipes

This is a project for The Odin Project Foundations course.  
Here I’ll build a basic recipe website using only HTML to demonstrate my understanding of:

- HTML boilerplate structure
- Creating links and images
- Working with lists and page navigation

At the end of the project, I’ll have a clear understanding of the basics of structuring a multi-page HTML site.
